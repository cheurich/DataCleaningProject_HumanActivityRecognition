### PROJECT GOAL

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my the ability to collect, clean and conduct exploratory data analysis on a data set.

### THIS REPO INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING FILES

* *"README.md"*: Explains the analysis files and give some general information about this project.

* *"getting_cleaning_data.R"*: The R script, contains all the code instructions needed, to output the dataframe for clustering analysis and the tidy data set from the raw data set.

* *"clustering_analysis.R"*: The script that analyses and plots the data, applying Hierarchical and K-Means clustering methods.

* *"clustering_analysis.Rmd"*: A R Markdown script, documenting the clustering analysis and visualise the data.

* *"CodeBook.md"*: Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that it have been performed to clean up the data. Shows information about the variables and the summaries calculated and the type. It contains also the list of all features in the tidy data.

* *"tidydata.txt"*: The tidy dataset, contains all the variables, grouped by each subject and activity, getting just 6 observations per volunteer, or just one value per activity and volunteer/subject.
